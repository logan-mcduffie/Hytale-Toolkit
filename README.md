## The Problem

Hytale's modding API is powerful but undocumented. As a mod developer, you're working blind:

- **No official documentation** - The server JAR has thousands of classes, but no guides on how to use them
- **No searchable reference** - You can't easily find the right class or method for what you need
- **No project templates** - Setting up a mod project from scratch means guessing at the build configuration
- **No AI assistance** - LLMs can't help because they don't have access to Hytale's codebase

You end up spending more time reverse-engineering the server than actually building your mod.

## The Solution

This toolkit gives you everything you need to understand and work with the Hytale server:

### 📚 Searchable Javadocs
Generate browsable API documentation from the decompiled server. Find classes, methods, and their signatures instantly.

### 🔍 AI-Powered Code Search
Ask natural language questions like *"how does player inventory work?"* and get relevant code snippets. Works with Claude Code, REST APIs, or any OpenAI-compatible client.

### 🚀 Ready-to-Use Templates
Start building immediately with a pre-configured Maven project. Or use the `/init-mod` command with your AI assistant to scaffold a complete mod in seconds.

### 💻 Full Source Access
When the docs aren't enough, browse the actual decompiled implementation to understand exactly how things work.
